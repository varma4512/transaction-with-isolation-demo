### 1. Read Uncommitted (Lowest isolation)
What it means: Transactions can see each other's uncommitted changes.
Problem: You might read data that's in the middle of being changed, which could result in seeing incorrect or partial data (called a "dirty read").
Analogy: Imagine peeking at someone’s unfinished homework and writing it down. They might change it later, but you already copied the incomplete version.

### 2. Read Committed
What it means: Transactions can only see changes made by other transactions after they’ve committed (finished).
Problem: You won’t see incomplete data, but the data you’re reading could change if another transaction commits its changes midway through your transaction.
Analogy: You read a document, but someone else is updating it while you’re reading. You might see different parts of it before they finish.

### 3. Repeatable Read
What it means: Once your transaction starts, the data you read won’t change, even if other transactions commit new changes during your transaction.
Problem: It prevents changes to the data you’ve read, but new rows added by others can still appear (called a "phantom read").
Analogy: You’re reading a book, and no one can change the pages while you're reading. However, someone can slip new pages into the book without you noticing.

### 4. Serializable (Highest isolation)
What it means: This level makes transactions behave as if they are completely isolated from each other, as if they are running one by one instead of simultaneously.
Benefit: It prevents all kinds of conflicts (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads). This is the strictest and safest level.
Analogy: You get exclusive access to the book while you’re reading it. No one else can even look at it until you’re done.


### Summary
Lower isolation levels allow more concurrency (many things happening at once) but risk inconsistent or incorrect data.
Higher isolation levels provide more data accuracy but can slow things down since transactions might have to wait for others to finish.
